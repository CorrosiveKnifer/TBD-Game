sfml - set origin to x,y (41,82)   for upperbody AND legs.

Box2D - size of box = (30,99), so->(15,50), set poistion of sprite to this centre.

draw legs first,(back)
then body, 	(middle)
then ball. 	(top layer)

Any vertical velocity should use legs-jump instead of running  -override.


// placement for ball overlay
Throw-mid-right from origin = x,y (-30,23)
Throw-mid-left from origin = x,y (30,23) (flipped)

Throw-diagDown-right from origin = x,y (-35,44)
Throw-diagDown-left from origin = x,y (35,44) (flipped)

Throw-diagUp-right from origin = x,y (-25,4)
Throw-diagUp-left from origin = x,y (25,4) (flipped)

Throw-down from origin = x,y (-6,48)

Throw-up from origin = x,y (-5,-10)
